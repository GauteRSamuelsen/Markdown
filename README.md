# Front page - Motion Matching guide

This is a documentation branch for another project. It is a User manual, tech specs and guides for how to set up a motion matching animation system in unreal engine 4.27.2.

The documents are categorized loosely by what person/professional might need to use them, but reading them all might give a better overview of features, possibilities and aid in communication.
